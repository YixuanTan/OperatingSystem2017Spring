SUBMITTY INPUT/OUTPUT GRADED TEST CASES FOR HOMEWORK 4

All six tests are run in the order shown below,
 with a one-second delay between each test.

Notes that the server is not shutdown between each test run.

================================================================================

Test 1:
-- start the server with "./a.out <port-number> <port-number>"
-- client A connects
-- client A sends "SAVE mouse.txt 917\n<mouse.txt>"  (use one packet here)
-- client A should receive "ACK\n"
-- client A sends "READ xyz.jpg 5555 2000\n"
-- client A should receive "ERROR NO SUCH FILE\n"
-- client A sends "LIST\n"
-- client A should receive "1 mouse.txt\n"
-- client A disconnects
